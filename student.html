                            Some of these students will pick courses related to their original field.
                            Whereby others will get out of their comfort zone during the program.
                            In this chapter we will let two of the studens tell their story.

                                    As I approach the end of my first year in the Master’s in Computational
                                    Science at the University of Amsterdam, I am genuinely impressed by how much I’ve
                                    learned, the connections I’ve made, and how inspired I feel by the work being done
                                    here.
                                    I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Purdue University in the U.S.
                                    and began working as an Actuarial Analyst afterwards. While the work was rewarding
                                    and meaningful, I felt a stronger pull towards academia and interdisciplinary
                                    research. During a semester abroad in Den Haag during my final year of my
                                    Bachelor’s, I become familiar with the education system in the Netherlands. Many
                                    students told me very positive things about the research opportunities and education
                                    at the University of Amsterdam which sparked my curiosity.

                                While searching for different programs that would combine my interests in
                                mathematics, science, and research, I came across the relatively new Computational
                                Science program here at UvA. Along with the interdisciplinary nature that
                                immediately stood out to me, I also noticed that those who graduated from this
                                program were able to go on to pursue careers in industry, research, or PhD programs.

                            <p class="text">
                                Since the moment I started this program, my confidence in my decision has only
                                grown. The curriculum allows you to explore various computational applications
                                across fields like finance, physics, biology, chemistry, high performance computing,
                                with a lot of flexibility in the courses you take. Students can also take classes at
                                the Vrije Universiteit, which adds so much more flexibility to which courses you can
                                take and what you can learn here.

                                Most importantly, the community and learning environment in the program is welcoming
                                and very collaborative. Since the students can come from all types of academic
                                backgrounds from all over the world, I really feel like I never stop learning from
                                the students around me. Professors are approachable and passionate about their work,
                                and it seems like they’re genuinely interested in our education and growth. The
                                program is challenging and has pushed me outside of my comfort zone, but even those
                                moments have been incredibly rewarding

                                    Hi! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in the Master's in
                                    Computational Science at the University of Amsterdam and looking for some insider
                                    insights. I’d be happy to help! My name is Timo, and I’m currently in the final two
                                    months of my first year of this two-year programme. I completed a Bachelor's in
                                    Economics and did a minor in Computer Programming at Science Park. Economics
                                    provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, while my minor
                                    taught me essential programming
                                    skills. Altogether, this background allowed me to meet the entry requirements for
                                    the
                                    Master's, and hence why I applied. A few weeks later I heard I got accepted. Great!
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p class="text">
                                On the UvA website, the Computational Science programme is described as follows: "In the
                                Master's programme Computational Science you learn to develop computational models
                                based on observations and data from physical, social, earth, economic and life
                                sciences."
                                When people ask what I study, I often start with something similar. As you progress
                                through the
                                programme, you'll find this description is accurate. Though it can sound a bit abstract
                                to
                                outsiders and if you give them this description you are often met with confused faces.
                                In those
                                cases, I usually say: “I basically do math, but instead of solving it myself, I let the
                                computer
                                figure it out. Oh, and also some AI.” For me, this sums it up nicely, especially since
                                I’ve chosen
                                a specialisation in Computational Finance and taken most of my electives in AI.

                                So, how do I find the Master's so far? I’m really enjoying it. First of all, the
                                community is great.
                                Almost everyone in our year is actively involved and knows each other through either
                                group
                                projects, lectures, or our famously exclusive Master's drinks. Second, coming from an
                                economics background, I’m learning a lot of new things. At first, I was a bit concerned
                                about the
                                level, but don’t worry, If you are willing to invest some time and effort, all courses
                                are more than
                                doable and great fun. Third, the freedom this programme offers is fantastic. It’s one of
                                the most
                                customizable Master’s in the Netherlands, making it ideal for exploring a wide range of
                                topics. In
                                my case, that has included brain imaging, finance, complex systems, and machine
                                learning. I
                                love this flexibility, it allows me to build a broad skill set while diving into new
                                areas that interest
                                me.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                In conclusion, if you enjoy working on complex problems using both mathematics and
                                programming in many different fields, this Master’s is a great fit. It’s a programme
                                that
                                challenges you, while offering a super fun and collaborative environment to grow and
                                learn in.
