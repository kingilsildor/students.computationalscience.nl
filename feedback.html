                            During the program it felt like there were too many fun courses, making it hard to choose
                            electives. This was especially true for block 1 and block 5.
                            Multiple students mentioned that they want to extend their master with a third year, to be
                            able to take more courses.

                        <p class="text">
                            Officially the program is a joint degree with VU, but in practice it feels like a UvA
                            degree. Some students would like to see more collaboration between the two universities,
                            for example by having joint projects or mandatory courses at the VU. This would also make
                            the
                            program more recognizable as a joint degree.
                            As it stands now, the VU is barely mentioned during the program, as seen at the statistics
                            page. Besides most of the students find the VU courses much easier than the UvA courses.

                            Some of the courses could be improved. For example, some students mentioned that the way
                            Stochastic Simulations was teached was not optimal, and that the course could benefit from
                            structure.
                            For the academic year 2025-2026, the course has been restructured with a new course
                            coordinator to improve the learning experience. Curious how this turn out!

                        <hr>
                        <p class="text">
                            As it is now, there is not much connection between the first and second year of the master.
                            Some students would like to see more connection between the two years, for example by having
                            activities that bring the two cohorts together.
                            This would also help to create a stronger community within the program and give some network
                            opportunities.
                            One of the possible reasons for this lack of connection is that the first year has some
                            mandatory courses, while the second year is fully elective and the thesis.
                            It is of course possible to find the different cohorts during these electives, but this is
                            not guaranteed and most of the time cliques form.
