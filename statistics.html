              On this page you can find various statistics of the student cohort, ranging from general statistics to
              topics surrounding the program and life as a student here. These statistics were obtained from a survey
              sent out to all CLS students currently enrolled, of which 48 responded.

              The following three graphs provide an overview of the students' ages, nationalities and previous studies.
              All, except for two students, stated that they have some previous work experience as well. Forty percent
              of all responses were from women.

              When asked what they appreciate about the program, the most common response was its broad nature. They
              value that we learn a set of skills that can be applied in various domains and that students have
              flexibility when it comes to choosing their courses. Images 4 and 6 show some insight into the student's
              study choices.

              Another regular response was to show appreciation for their classmates, teachers and staff. The students
              seem to like that there is diversity in nationalities and in academic backgrounds. There were multiple
              comments on the professors being knowledgeable, and the staff being helpful.

              What seems to be a commonly appreciated thing about the master program is its broad nature. Students
              appreciate that the program covers various domains and that they have flexibitiy when it comes to choosing
              classes. They note that the skillset we learn is applicable in real life.
              <br>
              Another thing that the students appreciate are the people in the program, both students and staff. They
              like the diversity in their collegues, that the professors seem motivated and knowledgable, and that the
              staff is kind and helpful.

              We asked the students about their experience with housing and if they had any interesting stories. About
              half of the responses stated that they had received very expensive offers. A few of these students still
              ended up accepting the offer, potentially from a lack of better options.

              Finally, we have arrived at the most important questions! We found that the colour green is the favourite
              colour of most students in this master's programme, whereas blue is the winning colour among the teachers.
