                            Welcome to the student chapter for the 2025 accreditation of the Computational
                            Science Master's programme! If you ended up on this website, you are probably interested in what studying
                            Computational Science is like for the students. Luckily, we have a lot to share with you on
                            this topic! First, let us briefly explain the purpose of this website and what we
                            aim to achieve.

                            Any degree programme in the Netherlands, needs to be accredited every 6 years. This is a
                            process where an independent committee verifies that the programme meets the necessary standards
                            of a Master's degree. As a part of this process, students are asked to create their own chapter
                            to share their experiences as students of the programme. The student chapter is form-free: it
                            can take the form of an analysis per assessment standard or a separate SWOT analysis, but it
                            can also be a video or the registration of a student meeting. This time we - Tycho, Sofia
                            and Mirjam - were given the opportunity to create the student chapter.
                            Inspired by our predecessors, we opted to build a
                            website where we share our experiences and those of our peers with you. In this way,
                            the chapter can also be used to inform prospective students and function as a time capsule
                            of our time in this wonderful Master's programme.

                            Computational Science is a field that uses computational models to answer research questions
                            that are otherwise hard to solve. These models are based on theory, data and observations of
                            the real-life systems. They allow us to gain insights into, experiment with, and make
                            predictions about complex systems in the real world. The field relies
                            on mathematics and computer science to build the models, however the applications of these
                            models are vast and diverse. Computational models can be used to answer research questions
                            about financial markets, medical interventions, the weather, crowd management, disease
                            outbreak and much more. This interdisciplinary nature makes it a challenging, but vibrant
                            field to study.

                            The Master's in Computational Science is a two year degree that teaches students to build and use
                            computational models to answer (research) questions. Due to its interdisciplinary nature,
                            students with various backgrounds are able to enroll, although a basic
                            understanding of mathematics and programming is required. During the programme,
                            students have a lot of freedom in choosing their courses and their preferred specialization,
                             whether this is complex systems, computational finance, high
                            performance computing or something else. On top of that, all students are required to complete a number of core
                            courses that teach them the most important tools every computational scientist should have
                            in their toolbox. Finally, each student applies the knowledge they have gathered during
                            the course of the programme to complete a 42 EC research project needed to graduate.
