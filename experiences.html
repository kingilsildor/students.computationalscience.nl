                            Student life is not always easy. Whether it is finding affordable housing, dealing with
                            mental health problems or staying on schedule with the workload, challenges abound! On this
                            page we will share some of the struggles of our current Computational Science students as
                            well as things they find easy and some tips to make life as a Computational Science student
                            easier.

                            To get a full view of the student experience, we did not only ask students for input, but
                            also four teachers. The teachers we interviewed are Gábor Závodszky, Clélia de Mulatier,
                            Vítor Vasconcelos and Mike Lees. With their knowledge on what is expected from students,
                            seeing them succeed (or not) every year and having been a student once themselves, they have
                            interesting insights on what life is now studying Computational Science. Of course, some
                            things have changed since they were themselves students. For one, Clelia notes that due to
                            technological developments, teachers are now a lot more accessible outside of the classroom,
                            through email or Canvas. Besides the accessibility, students’ expectations have changed as
                            well, posits Gabor. Students now expect more predictability from the teachers: they want to
                            know more about what is asked from them in the course, for example by getting a sample exam
                            in preparation for the real one. Finally, Vitor adds that on the content side a lot has
                            changed as well. Now, studying has become more interdisciplinary and more aimed at
                            applications. Studying, in his opinion, has become more impact focused, while knowing for
                            the sake of knowing has lost some ground.
                            <br><br>
                            With these changes in mind, let’s dive into the experiences of students of Computational
                            Science. We will first discuss what is easy and what is a struggle for students, both from
                            the students’ and the teachers’ perspective. Afterwards, we will share how the students deal
                            with stress and we will end with sharing some advice the teachers have for (prospective)
                            Computational Science students.

                        <hr>
                        <h3>What students think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            When we categorize the students' answers to the questions what they find easy as a student,
                            the category most mentioned is 'study related'. This category entails everything that has to
                            do with the content of the program as well as doing the actual work on the assignments.
                            Within this category answers differ. Some find the maths easy, while others actually think
                            the programming is the easiest part and then there are even people who think writing the
                            reports is easy. This very clearly reflects the broad nature of the program and especially
                            the very diverse backgrounds of our students. Some of whom are more experienced
                            mathematicians, some more experienced programmers and others more experienced writers.
                            Surprisingly, the second biggest category is work-life balance. Quite a few students
                            indicate not having any trouble balancing studying, with working, working out, having a
                            social life and sleeping enough hours every night. An incredible feat if you ask the
                            authors! Close to the 'work-life balance' is the category of 'socializing'. Apparently, our
                            students love to chat!
                            <br><br>
                            Besides the answers that we were able to categorize, we also received a few interesting
                            unique answers. For example, one student shared with us that they find it easy to go find a
                            free restroom in the city centre because they can always enter the library on the Singel.
                            Another student shares with us that they find it easy to find a good study place and that
                            Science Park is an excellent campus.

                        <h3>What teachers think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            For the teachers determining what students find easy was a bit difficult. However, the
                            teachers did notice as well that due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program,
                            students find some parts easier than others. They are impressed by the ability of most
                            students to adapt to all the different topics of the program, create their own trajectory in
                            their studies and be well prepared for their thesis once they get there.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="struggle">What is a struggle?</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>What students think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            There is a clear category that is by far the largest, when it comes to what students note as
                            their (biggest) struggle: work-life balance. Students find it hard to balance it all:
                            studying, working, exercising, sleeping enough, socializing and having hobbies. Trying to do
                            it all, can cause a good amount of stress. Later on we will share how our students deal with
                            this stress. The second biggest category is study-related. Here we again see the effects of
                            the interdisciplinary master in combination with having a student body with a diverse
                            background. Students who do not have a strong background in a certain topic, note that they
                            struggle with that specific topic within the master.
                            <br><br>
                            Other interesting and noteworthy struggles are staying motivated, housing, mental health,
                            paying the bills and socializing. One person even noted 'dating' as one of their struggles!
                            Interestingly, a lot of the topics noted as a struggle, were also present for some students
                            as something they find easy. When it comes to work-life balance, dealing with certain topics
                            in the program, socializing and staying motivated, there are students who find it easy and
                            students who struggle with it. Our students could really help each other out a lot!
                        </p>
                        <h3>What teachers think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            The teachers acknowledge the difficulties in work-life balance for the students. They note
                            that there is a lot of pressure on students to work, either for financial reasons or for
                            boosting their CV, but that it is very difficult to combine a master's degree with working.
                            On the content-side they also recognize that depending on their background, some students
                            struggle more with some parts of the program than others. The interdisciplinary nature of
                            the master is also seen as a challenge. As a student you need to be an expert in the
                            techniques and the domain you apply it to. You need to learn the methods, but also to apply
                            them to very different contexts.
                            <br><br>
                            Even though the teachers recognize the struggles of the students, they also state that the
                            master is supposed to be challenging and that the stakes seem high but that this master also
                            provides a safespace to make mistakes. One teacher expressed their hope that students find
                            it easy to talk to each other and the staff whenever the challenge seems to be too high.

                        <h2 id="stess">How do students deal with stress?</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p class="text">
                            We also asked our students how they deal with stress. The two most popular answers are doing
                            some type of work-out or planning out what needs to be done and start working even harder.
                            Other popular answers are doing something relaxing, like gaming or reading a book, eating
                            something (unhealthy), or socializing and finding support from other students.
                            <br><br>
                            There were a few answers that stood out. One student shared that they would exercise and
                            read about real-world problems to deal with stress. There really is nothing like the current
                            state of the world to put your personal troubles into perspective! On a related note, two
                            students admitted to crying to release some stress. One student opts for doing something
                            creative, while another distracts themself by going motorcycling. Other suggestions were
                            taking a break, yoga or meditation. One student kept their answer on how they deal with
                            stress short and sweet: 'beers'.
                            <br><br>
                            Hopefully, the answers give you some inspiration on how to deal with stress or, if not, that
                            they at least are relatable. If you are looking for a bit more support, read along! We will
                            now share the advice the teachers have for their students!

                        <h2 id="teacher-advice">What are advices from the teachers?</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p class="text">
                            Here are, in no particular order, the advices the teachers shared with us:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Make the program your own.</b>
                                <br>
                                You have a lot of options in this program and making
                                it your own is the key to success. Think about the future, what you enjoy doing and take
                                some time to explore!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Really take your breaks and holidays.</b>
                                <br>
                                You really need to decompress. A bit of catching
                                up is allowed, but make sure you also take full days off from studying. One teacher
                                confided in us that in the period they worked the hardest, they also partied the
                                hardest. This provided the right balance they needed!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Work regularly.</b>
                                <br>
                                Find ways to really force yourself to work regularly instead of having to catch up on
                                all the work in the last week of a course.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Interact with teachers.</b>
                                <br>
                                It can be really beneficial to talk to your teachers in class and during breaks. Most
                                teachers appreciate this, there is no reason to be shy!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>No need for balance.</b>
                                <br>
                                Studying might not be the time for balance and that is okay. Don't spend too much energy
                                on trying to achieve that.
                            </li>
                            <br>

                                <b>Challenge yourself.</b>
                                <br>
                                Studying is the perfect time to challenge yourself. Try to learn as much as possible and
                                don't be afraid to fail. The stakes might feel high, but you are, maybe for the last
                                time in life, in a protective bubble where you can fail and try again!
