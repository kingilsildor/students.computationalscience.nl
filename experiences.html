                            Student life is not always easy. Whether it is finding affordable housing, dealing with
                            mental health problems or staying on schedule with the workload, challenges are abound! On
                            this
                            page we will share some of the struggles of our current Computational Science students as
                            well as things they find easy and some tips to make life as a Computational Science student
                            easier.

                            To get a full view of the student experience, we did not only ask students for input, but
                            also four teachers. The teachers we interviewed are Gábor Závodszky, Clélia de Mulatier,
                            Vítor Vasconcelos and Mike Lees. With their knowledge on what is expected from students,
                            by seeing those students succeed (or not) every year, and by having been a student once
                            themselves, they have an unique perspective on what life is like today as a student of
                            Computational Science. Of course, some things have changed since they were themselves
                            students.
                            For one, Clelia notes that due to technological developments, teachers are now a lot more
                            accessible outside of the classroom, through email or Canvas. Besides the accessibility,
                            students' expectations have changed as well, posits Gabor. Students now expect more
                            predictability
                            from the teachers: they want to know more about what is asked from them in the course, for
                            example
                            by getting a sample exam in preparation for the real one. Vitor adds that on the content
                            side a lot has
                            changed as well. Now, studying has become more interdisciplinary and more aimed at (usefull)
                            applications. Studying, in his opinion, has become more impact focused, while knowing for
                            the sake of knowing has lost some ground. Finally, Mike notes that there have been great
                            developments
                            in programming and programming languages since he was a student himself. He adds that
                            students can
                            take a lot more, but that there is also a lot more that is expected of them. Today, students
                            need
                            to be quick, but still acquire a deep understanding of the subjects.
                            <br><br>
                            With these changes in mind, let's dive into the experiences of students of Computational
                            Science. We will first discuss what is easy and what is a struggle for students, both from
                            the students' and the teachers' perspective. Afterwards, we will share how the students deal
                            with stress and we will end with sharing some advice the teachers and we, the authors, have
                            for (prospective)
                            Computational Science students.

                        <h3>What students think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            When we categorize the students' answers to the question what they find easy as a student,
                            the most popular category is 'study related'. This category entails everything that has to
                            do with the content of the program as well as doing the actual work on the assignments.
                            Within this category answers between students differ. Some find the maths easy, while others
                            actually think the programming is the easiest part and then there are even people who have
                            no
                            problems with writing the reports. This variety very clearly reflects the broad nature of
                            the
                            program and the very diverse backgrounds of our students, some of whom are more experienced
                            mathematicians, some more experienced programmers and others more experienced writers.
                            Surprisingly, the second biggest category is work-life balance. Quite a few students
                            indicate not having any trouble balancing studying with working, exercising, having a
                            social life and sleeping enough hours. An incredible feat if you ask the authors!
                            Close to the 'work-life balance' is the category of 'socializing'. Apparently, a lot of our
                            students love to chat and have a good time with each other!
                            <br><br>
                            Besides the answers that we were able to categorize, we also received a few interesting and
                            unique answers. For example, one student shared with us that they find it easy to go find a
                            free restroom in the city centre because they can always enter the library on the Singel!
                            Another student shares with us that they find it easy to find a good study place and that
                            Science Park is an excellent campus.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What teachers think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            For the teachers determining what students find easy was a bit difficult. However, they
                            do notice as well that due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program, some
                            students find some parts easier than others. They are impressed by the ability of most
                            students to adapt to all the different topics of the program, to create their own trajectory
                            in
                            their studies and to be well prepared for their thesis once they get there.

                        <h3>What students think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            For this question, there is a clear category that is by far the largest when it comes to
                            what
                            students note as their (biggest) struggle: 'work-life balance'. Unsuprisingly, a lot of
                            students
                            find it hard to balance studying with working, exercising, sleeping enough, socializing and
                            having hobbies. Trying to do it all, can cause a good amount of stress. Below we will
                            discuss
                            how our students deal with this stress. The second biggest category is 'study-related'. Here
                            we again see the effects of the interdisciplinary nature of this master in combination with
                            having a student body with diverse backgrounds. Students who do not have a strong background
                            in a certain topic, note that they struggle with that specific topic within the master.
                            <br><br>
                            Other interesting and noteworthy struggles are 'staying motivated', 'housing', 'mental
                            health',
                            'paying the bills' and 'socializing'. One person even noted 'dating' as one of their
                            struggles!
                            Interestingly, a lot of the topics noted as a struggle, were also present for some students
                            as something they find easy. When it comes to work-life balance, dealing with certain topics
                            in the program, socializing or staying motivated, there are students who find it easy and
                            students who struggle with it. Our students could really help each other out a lot!
                        </p>
                        <h3>What teachers think</h3>
                        <p class="text">
                            The teachers acknowledge the difficulties of students in maintaining a work-life balance
                            during
                            the master. They note that there is a lot of pressure on students to work besides their
                            studies,
                            either for financial reasons or for boosting their CV, but that it is also very difficult to
                            combine a master's degree with working. On the content-side they also recognize that
                            depending
                            on their background, some students struggle more with some parts of the program than others.
                            The interdisciplinary nature of the master is also seen as a challenge. As a student you
                            need
                            to be an expert in both the techniques and as well as the domain you apply it to. You need
                            to
                            learn the methods, but also learn how to apply them to very different contexts.
                            <br><br>
                            Even though the teachers recognize the struggles of the students, they also state that the
                            master is supposed to be challenging and that the stakes seem high but that the program also
                            provides a safespace to make mistakes. One teacher expressed their hope that students talk
                            to each
                            other and the staff whenever the challenge seems to be too high.

                        <h2 id="stess">How do students deal with stress?</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p class="text">
                            We also asked our students how they deal with stress. The two most popular answers are doing
                            some type of work-out or planning out what needs to be done and start working even harder.
                            Other popular answers are doing something relaxing, like gaming or reading a book, eating
                            something (unhealthy), or socializing and finding support from other students.
                            <br><br>
                            There were a few answers that stood out. One student shared that they would exercise and
                            read about real-world problems to deal with stress. There really is nothing like the current
                            state of the world to put your personal troubles into perspective! On a related note, two
                            students admitted to crying to release some stress. One student opts for doing something
                            creative, while another distracts themself by going motorcycling. Other suggestions were
                            taking a break, yoga or meditation. One student kept their answer on how they deal with
                            stress short and sweet: 'beers'.
                            <br><br>
                            Hopefully, these answers give you some inspiration on how to deal with stress or, if not,
                            that
                            they at least are relatable and make you feel less alone. If you are looking for a bit more
                            support, read along! We will now share what advice the teachers have for the students!

                        <hr>
                        <p class="text">
                            Here are, in no particular order, the advices the teachers shared with us:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Make the program your own.</b>
                                <br>
                                You have a lot of options in this program and making
                                it your own is the key to success. Think about the future, what you enjoy doing and take
                                some time to explore!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Really take your breaks and holidays.</b>
                                <br>
                                You really need to decompress. A bit of catching
                                up is allowed, but make sure you also take full days off from studying. One teacher
                                confided in us that in the period they worked the hardest, they also partied the
                                hardest. This provided the right balance they needed, so don't be afraid to let loose
                                once in a while!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Work regularly.</b>
                                <br>
                                Find ways to really force yourself to work regularly instead of having to catch up on
                                all the work in the last week of a course.

                                <br>
                                It can be really beneficial to talk to your teachers in class and during breaks. Most
                                teachers really appreciate this, so there is no reason to be shy!

                                <b>No need for balance.</b>
                                <br>
                                Studying might not be the time for balance and that is okay. Don't spend too much energy
                                on trying to achieve that.

                                <br>
                                Studying is the perfect time to challenge yourself. Try to learn as much as possible and
                                don't be afraid to fail. The stakes might feel high, but you are, maybe for the last
                                time in life, in a protective bubble where you are allowed to fail and try again!

                            Being Computational Science students ourselves, we, the authors, have some experience with
                            the trials
                            and tribulations of doing this master. To finish off this section, we would love to share
                            some tips,
                            again in no particular order:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Don’t be afraid to ask for help.</b>
                                <br>
                                This advice is useful and true throughout your life, but also especially during your
                                studies.
                                In this program, there are a lot of people you can turn to when you need help. There are
                                teachers,
                                TAs, tutors, the study advisor and the program coordinator, to name a few. Maybe the
                                best and least
                                intimidating place to start asking questions are your fellow students. As discussed
                                before, what
                                you are struggling with might be their expertise and if not it can be really comforting
                                to know
                                others are struggling with the same thing too.

                            <li>
                                <b>Don’t study alone.</b>
                                <br>
                                Even if you are not working on the same thing, it can be really motivating to see others
                                work (and struggle) too.

                                <b>Aim for progress, not perfection.</b>
                                <br>
                                Do not waste your time trying to perfect things that are already good. In an experiment
                                where some students had
                                to paint one amazing painting (quality) and others had to paint 100 mediocre paintings
                                (quantity) for their
                                final assignment, it turned out that the quantity paintings were better than the quality
                                ones. Sometimes, it
                                is better to focus on finishing something and moving on, instead of trying to make
                                something perfect. The same
                                goes for your work schedule. Don’t spend too much time on making it perfect, it is all
                                about making progress and
                                getting better, not about getting it perfect!

                            <li>
                                <b>Work assignments backwards.</b>
                                <br>
                                Sometimes, if you do not know where to start with an assignment, look at what the final
                                product should be and work
                                your way backwards. Ask yourself the question: ‘what do I need to figure out to be able
                                to get the results I need?’
                                and then ‘what do I need to figure out to figure that previous thing out?’, etc!

                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Breaks are non negotiable!</b>
                                <br>
                                Everyone needs breaks. They are really important for your (mental) health and will in
                                the long run be essential for
                                your progress. Figure out what type of break schedule works for you: a few minutes every
                                hour or a long one hour
                                lunch break or no more studying after a certain time or something else!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Don’t procrastinate, but if you do, be kind to yourself.</b>
                                <br>
                                Of course, it is always better to keep to your schedule and not procrastinate, but don’t
                                beat yourself up if you end
                                up procrastinating anyways. Sometimes, procrastinating is not about being lazy or
                                unmotivated, but about being
                                overwhelmed and needing a break. There is no use in beating yourself up for not studying
                                when you should. If you
                                take time off, whether you feel like you deserve it or not, enjoy it! Trust you will get
                                the work done in time and
                                realize that even if not, the world will not end and you are allowed to make mistakes.
