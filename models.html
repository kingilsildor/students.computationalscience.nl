                            As a Computational Science student, you work a lot with creating models for different
                            real life problems. On this page you can find some of the models we have made, and subjects you might
                            come across during the program. Given the wide range of potential applications, some students
                            choose to focus on a specific domain, while others keep their approach broad to
                            remain adaptable across multiple domains.

                            To see how complex systems like traffic emerge, we modelled traffic flow through a roundabout
                            in a city. In this image the cars are the red squares, while the central brown squares
                            represent the roundabout.
                            The model was made to be as simple as possible, and only uses the following local rules:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cars try to move at maximum speed on straight roads.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars stop when there is a car in front of them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars move on the rotary until the flag changes to "exit".
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        The following assumptions were made:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cars can instantly move to full speed and can break instantly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars don't have a predefined destination.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars can never overtake another car.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        In this model, we observed that the density of cars had an impact on 
                        traffic jams, as one would expect from real life. We also noted that a change in speed
                        limit didn't affect the traffic jams much.

                            During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was mandantory to walk certain routes within supermarkets. For one of our projects we
                            created a model that would help us determine whether this strategy was indeed more efficient in dicreasing the spread of COVID-19 than letting people walk normally.
                            To do this, we used an Agent-Based Modeling approach, in which agents move across a
                            custom-designed
                            network. The assumption was that only a certain number of agents could occupy a single
                            node at a time.
                            Walking paths were designed based on the shopping list of the customers, with some added noise
                            to account for agents walking backward and forward.
                            The darker a node is, the higher the probability is to get infected there.

                            The SIR model is a simple and widely used epidemiological model that describes how a disease
                            spreads through a fixed population. It is one of the first models you will encounter when studying this master's programme.
                            The model divides the population into three compartments:
                            Susceptible (<b>S</b>), Infected (<b>I</b>), and Recovered (<b>R</b>). Individuals move from
                            being
                            susceptible to infected at a transmission rate β when they come into contact with an infected person. 
                            They recover from infection at a rate γ, after which they become immune. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is a simple, yet effective, model. Since it can capture key dynamics of disease spread, it was widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            However, this is
                            a deterministic model, meaning that given the initial conditions, we know how the system
                            evolves. In reality, pandemics involve elements of randomness, making them non-deterministic, which this model fails to account for.
