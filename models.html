                            As a Computational Science student, you will work a lot with creating models for different
                            real life problems. On this page we placed some of our models we made, or things you would
                            see often durring the program.Given the wide range of potential applications, some students
                            will choose to focus on a specific domain, while others will keep their approach broad to
                            remain applicable across multiple domains.

                            To see how complex systems like traffic emerge, we modeled traffic flow through a roundabout
                            in a city. For this image the cars are the red squared, whereby the roundabout is the centre
                            brown square.
                            This model was made as simple as possible, by only using local rules. The
                            following rules were defined:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cars will try to move at maximum speed on straight roads.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars will stop when a car is in front of them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars will move on the rotary until the flag is changed to exit.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        Hereby the following assumptions were made:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Cars can move instantly to full speed and will break instantly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars don't have a predefined destination.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cars can only move as far as they can, never overtaking another car.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Besides these simple rules, we could still observere that the density of cars made a big
                        difference on traffic jams, as one would expect from real life. Hereby the change in speed
                        limits didn't change that much.

                            During COVID it was mandantory to walk certain routes within supermarkets. As a project we
                            modelled if this was indeed more efficient to dicrease the spreading of COVID, compared to
                            normal paths.
                            For this we used an Agent-Based Modeling approach, in which agents moved across a
                            custom-designed
                            network. The assumption was made that only a certain amount of agents could occupy a single
                            node.
                            The walking paths were designed based on the shopping list of the customers, with some noise
                            added so that the agents could walk back and forward.
                            How darker the node, how higher the probability to get infected.

                            The SIR model is a simple and widely used epidemiological model that describes how a disease
                            spreads through a fixed population. It divides the population into three compartments:
                            Susceptible (<b>S</b>), Infected (<b>I</b>), and Recovered (<b>R</b>). Individuals move from
                            being
                            susceptible to infected when they come into contact with an infected person, with a
                            transmission rate of β and they recover at a rate of γ, after which they become immune.
                            <br>
                            It is a simple but effective model and it was used a lot during COVID, because it can
                            capture the key dynamics. But given the nature of the model, every person is contacted with
                            every other person in the population. Something that doesn't happen in real life. Besides it
                            is a deterministic model, meaning that based on the initial parameters we can show how the
                            system evolves. Given that real life is non deterministic, this can couse some problems.
                            <br>
                            This is one of the first models you would learn when participating this master program.
