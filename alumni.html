                            Diverse horizons and evolving ambitions define the Master of Computational Science cohort.
                            Some of these  will pick courses related to their original field.
                            Whereby others will get out of their comfort zone during the program.
                            In this chapter we will let two of the studens tell their story. #TODO

                                    My experience in the master Computational Science (CLS) program jointly administered
                                    by the UvA and the VU was very positive! The course content prepared me for a broad
                                    array of computational work ranging from software engineering (scientific or
                                    otherwise) to more academic pursuits like a Ph.D.

                                    While my focus was in high performance computing, the master CLS program introduced
                                    me to topics in numerical
                                    partial differential equations, uncertainty quantification, and various performance
                                    optimization techniques that directly impact my work now as a research software
                                    engineer in weather and climate modelling.
                                    <!-- <br> -->
                                    While I had no prior experience in the
                                    atmospheric physics associated with my current job, the flexibility of the master
                                    CLS program combined with the high quality theoretical and practical instruction
                                    greatly facilitated fast acquisition of the necessary skills to contribute to a
                                    domain outside my direct training. Lastly, the program coordinators were open to
                                    feedback from students and made curriculum changes based on student input, so this
                                    demonstrates the high degree of agency masters CLS students have in their own
                                    studies.

                                    My experience at the UvA was one of the most enriching experiences of my life. Right
                                    from
                                    the first day to the last I was pushed to be creative, to be curious, to be
                                    inquisitive.
                                    The atmosphere of collaborative development and the constant hunger for learning really
                                    shaped my outlook quite comprehensively. By meeting up with people from all over
                                    the
                                    world and with various different backgrounds, it was exciting to see how different
                                    minds
                                    think about a particular problem. It opened up possibilities that one wouldn’t think
                                    of
                                    and hence gave the opportunity to constantly be a sponge and keep on learning, how
                                    to
                                    adapt, change course if necessary and tackle the same problems. Personally, it was
                                    quite
                                    a journey for me as, coming from India, the environment is quite different here.
                                    The
                                    welcoming nature of every single individual that I came across gave me immense
                                    strength
                                    during this journey and for that I’m grateful to the UvA for giving me this opportunity
                                    that
                                    helped me evolve both personally and professionally. This master acted as a springboard for me
                                    from
                                    which I can now take on these learnings and apply them to the field I’m working on.
